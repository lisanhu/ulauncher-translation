# ulauncher-translation
Yet Another Translation Plugin for Ulauncher

## Usage
1. Set up the preferences
2. Use it

### Setup
1. Setup your preferred languages. Input text will be translated into all these languages (same language will also occupy a row). You will have to enter language codes instead of language names. You can find language codes [here](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages)
2. Enter your google cloud translation API_KEY. You will need to provide your own key, since this will be put online publicly on github. I can't afford to reveal my own key or to create an online service.
   - You can get your key following [this](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup)

### Usage
Keyword is `tr`, it can be changed in the preference
1. Open Ulauncher input
2. Enter your keyword with a space
3. Enter the text you want to translate
4. Wait for the plugin to process the translation and return the result. The rows can be selected and the translation will be copied to the clipboard.
